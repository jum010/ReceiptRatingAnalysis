# Cooking Clock: Analyzing the Relationship Between Recipe Duration and Ratings
Authors: Cecilia Li & Marina Ma
## Oveview
This is the DSC80 project at UCSD, which is based on exploring the relationship between receipt rating and different periods of cooking time.
## Introduction
We chose the Recipes and Ratings dataset because it is ideal for our project, combining detailed recipe attributes (including nutrition information such as calorie count) with user interactions (ratings and reviews). As college students who work out often, we are particularly interested in exploring the relationship between caloric content and user preference, analyzing whether higher or lower-calorie recipes tend to receive better ratings. Additionally, this dataset allows us to apply predictive modeling to forecast recipe ratings based on key factors such as calories, ingredients, and preparation time. This will help uncover trends in recipe popularity and provide insights into how nutritional content influences user perception. By understanding these patterns, we can better understand health-conscious eating habits and consumer preferences in online recipe platforms.
